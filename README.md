# capstone-2022

My senior project at YSU for fall 2022, I recieved an A and graduated with my BS in computer science and minor in math.
I designed a small game demo with combat mechanics derived from a mix of Final Fantasy VII Remake and Pokemon.

Some things of note about this project:
 - This was my first time using Unity in 3D!
 - The focus was on the design and structure of the game, rather than graphics (which is why the models are all blocks)
 - Specifically, I wanted to highlight my finite state machine designs for the AI
 - There are missing features which didn't make it into the final product mostly due to time, maybe I'll revisit this someday and add them!
 
If you want to download my game and try it for yourself, downlaod the contents in the folder labelled "Game". Once you download the files, running the .exe should bring up the main menu screen.

*THIS HAS ONLY BEEN TESTED ON WINDOWS*

Controls:
 - WASD moves the player
 - Look around with the mouse
 - Press F to open the on-screen menu and use the listed keys to navigate (Q, E, C)
